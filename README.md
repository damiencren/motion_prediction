# Motion Detection

> This project is a mobile application developed with React Native, integrating a deep learning model to detect user movements, such as walking or lying down. It aligns with my academic program.

### ðŸ“Œ Features

- Real-time motion detection using smartphone sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope).

- Deep learning model based on LSTM for accurate sequence analysis.

- Simple and intuitive interface displaying real-time predictions.

- Deployment via Expo (EAS) for simplified installation.

### ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- React Native for mobile app development.

- TensorFlow.js for deep learning model integration on mobile.

- Google Colab for model training.

- scikit-learn for data preprocessing.

### ðŸš€ Installation & Execution

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/damiencren/motion_prediction
cd motion_prediction
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the application in development mode

```bash
npx expo start
```

### ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements

- Optimizing model performance on mobile.

- Exploring hybrid architectures combining CNN + LSTM.

- Improved calibration for better prediction accuracy.
